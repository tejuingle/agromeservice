It is an effective tool for the control of a broad spectrum of pests which are otherwise difficult to control. Thiacloprid, due to its rain-fastness property, is stable even under conditions of heavy rains and sunlight providing longer persistence. Thiacloprid is antagonist to the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor in the central nervous system. It disturbs the proper signal transmission system leading to excitation of nerve cell. Consequently a disorder of the nervous system occurs leading finally to the death of the treated insect. Due to its relative stability to rain-water and sunlight, Alanto remains on the leafs surface after application for a considerable time, thus allowing a continuous penetration of the active ingredient into the leaf Alanto covers broad range of targeted pests, viz., aphids, whiteflies, thrips, and lepidopterans No cross resistance to conventional insecticides, with fast degradation in the environment Alanto shows a low acute mammalian toxicity, due to relatively low rates of application, excellent plant compatibility and a favourable eco-toxicological profile Crops: Cotton, Chilli, Rice, Apple, Tea, Brinjal, Soyabean Target Pests: Aphids, Jassids,Thrips, White Fly, Stem Borer, Mosquito Bug, Shoot and Fruit Borer, Girdle Beetle Dose: 2 ml/liter Pack sizes: 100 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml, 1 L The information provided here is for reference only.

It is also proven that amino acids facilitate penetration of nutrients in the plant system (chelating effect of glycine) and activate defense enzymes for increased tolerance to abiotic stress. Fulvic acids are powerful carriers of essential nutrients into the plant cells. They enhance the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes involved in plant tolerance to abiotic stress. Ambition has high concentration of amino acids that promotes growth, vitality and crop performance Amino acids and fulvic acids ensures enhanced penetration of nutrients and stress resilience. They activate the plant’s defense enzyme systems for increased tolerance to abiotic stress Ambition improves flower retention, fruit set and increases marketable produce Ambition is an organic solution and does not leave residues. Hence it can be used at any stage of the crop growth Time of application: Ambition is recommended as a foliar spray at 2-3 ml/L water or 1L/acre as drench application. 3-4 applications are recommended for best results: 1st application during the vegetative phase of the crop, 2nd application during flowering stage and 2-3 applications during fruit development stage.

                **ABOUT PRODUCT**:
                - Antracol contains Propineb, a contact fungicide with broad-spectrum activity against various diseases of rice, chilli, grapes, potato, and other vegetables and fruits.
                - Propineb is a polymeric zinc-containing dithiocarbamate. Due to the release of zinc, the application of Antracol results in a greening effect on the crop and subsequent improvement in the quality of the produce.
        
                **MODE OF ACTION**:
                - Propineb interferes at different locations in the metabolism of the fungi, affecting several points in the respiration chain, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and the cell membranes.
                - This multi-site mode of action prevents the development of resistance in the fungi.
        
                **ADVANTAGES**:
                - Broad spectrum of activity.
                - Both contact and preventive action.
                - Due to its complex multi-site mode of action, Antracol is ideal for spraying programs to combat and prevent the selection of resistant fungal populations.
                - Superior formulation with fine particle size for better suspension in water.
                - Rainfastness leads to better efficacy.
                - Availability of zinc, which has a positive effect on the crop and improves immunity, resulting in higher yields and better quality.
                - Safety: Extremely low toxicity, making Antracol ideal for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs.
        
                **CROP AND TARGET DISEASE**:
                - Antracol should be applied as a protectant fungicide.
